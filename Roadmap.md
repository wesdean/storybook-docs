### <a id="ui-offline">Offline / collaborative editing</a>

- Users should be notified when their device is offline. (via a permenantly visible notification bar)
- Users should be notified when other users are editing same fork. 
- When an offline user submits a change, the fork should be checked for other edits. If other edits exist, user should be given the option to overwrite based on role. (ie. author can overwrite contributor, contributor cannot overwrite author)
- A real-time database, such as Firebase, should be used for collaborative editing. Persistent changes should be saved to backend database.
